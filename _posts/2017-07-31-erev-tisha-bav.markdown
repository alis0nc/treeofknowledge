I've finally figured out what for to mourn on Tisha b'Av if not for the bais hamikdash. 
Definitely current instances of antisemitism, but also for the Israeli occupation of Gaza 
and the West Bank. Thinking abouty this is in no small part due to the Havdalah event I attended
with Rachel and Molly last shabbos, where Rabbi Alana and Justin talked about their involvement 
this spring with a nonviolent resistance project in Palestine, Sumud Freedom Camp. They talked 
about how Israeli settlers would throw feces down on Palestinian houses and refuse to pick up 
trash or sweep the streets, in order to make conditions so unliveable that the Palestinian 
households would just leave "of their own accord". One thing that stuck out at me especially 
was that Israelis would build buildings around an existent Palestinian house and surround it 
on all sides, such that the only entry or exit was 20 metres down a precarious rope ladder. 
Justin said, "This fight is being fought square metre by square metre."
