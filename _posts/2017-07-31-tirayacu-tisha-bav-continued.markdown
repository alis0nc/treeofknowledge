The following is a continuation of my notes on the Tisha b'Av chapter of *This Is Real And You Are Completely Unprepared*.

 * *acknowledge our complicity* in what happens to us, and change so it doesn't happen again
   * take responsibility, learn from history
   * counterpoint: were we complicit in Shoah? or contemporary antisemitism? haters gonna hate
 * Lew thinks *those who insist on remembering history are doomed to repeat it* -- parallels I-P conflict
   * Jews want vindication
   * israel was attacked first (1948, 1967, 1973, both Intifadas)
   * Palestinians want vindication too. Modernism was thrust upon them, European problem was 
     thrust upon them, (they had no role in the Shoah)
 * a gentle occupation doesn't exist (this means more now that I'm reading this *after* "Havdallah Against the Occupation")
 * neither side wants to acknowledge the other side's suffering because to acknowledge the other side's suffering 
   is to admit wrongdoing is to make themselves vulnerable to annihiliation
   * same can apply to us on a personal level
 * Tisha b'Av. beginnings of teshuva. repentance. (re)turning
 * psalm 121 -- behold, the guardian of israel neither slumbers nor sleeps. HaShem will guard you and keep you at 
   his right hand
 * Torah study! "follow the language". Repeating a shoresh multiple times for emphasis
 * Devarim: פ-נ-ה, Turn. how appropriate for a parsha that begins the days of teshuva. *the turning point*
 * Sevens
   * 7 weeks before Pesach, on Shabbat Shekalim, we begin our spiritual spring cleaning of hametz
   * 7 weeks of the Omer, between Pesach and Shavuot
   * 7 weeks between Tisha b'Av and Rosh HaShana
 * Endless cycle. fullness --> decline --> destruction --> renewal --> teardown --> rebuilding
![Endless cycle](/treeofknowledge/images/endlesscycle.png)
 * how appropriate to think about this endless cycle on the 50th anniversary of the Detroit 1967 rebellions, 
   and thinking about the decline/destruction/renewal of Detroit
 * Kohenet spiral song
 * Torah spends A LOT of time on the Mishkan. Should we internalise the Mishkan?
 * Calendar -- 3 fast days about the destruction of the Temple / Jerusalem
   * 10 Tevet (Babylonian Siege of Jerusalem)
   * 17 Tammuz
   * 9 Av
 * Fast of Gedalia (after Rosh HaShana) marks the beginning of exile/diaspora
 * The Holy of Holies was mostly empty. Sounds nihilist but ok. Void worshippers.
 * with the Temple destroyed, this emptiness escaped and consumed all.
 * we're afraid of The Void, so we fill our lives with possessions, monetary wealth. we put up a front 
   * what the hell is the antidote to this??!!
   * "what do you do" -- defined by your contribution to capitalism. I talked about this at last shabbos 
     dinner
   * Counterpoint tho. I have no idea what several of my Penguicon and shul friends do for their day jobs
 * Fronting / putting up walls. Tisha b'Av as the destruction of those fronts and the exposure of your true self
   * interesting idea!!
 * "What is required ... decision to change" (60)
   * reexamine unconscious habits, approach life and decisions with Kavanah. Consciousness, intention. 
     Tchiyah and our baalei tefilah are good at infusing davening with kavanah. Now apply that to life at large
 * point about impermanence -- you can't go home again? like my mom's old dorm at CMU now being but a green space
 * I almost cried at my therapist appointment this afternoon. Talk about walls coming down.
