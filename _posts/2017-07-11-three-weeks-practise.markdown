Maybe reconstructing a mourning practise for the Three Weeks from 17 Tammuz to 9 Av would focus on
contemporary issues, like present-day antisemitism, or islamophobia, or queerphobia? Since one 
[abstains from new clothes, wine, and meat](https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/the-three-weeks/), 
and some even [refrain from listening to music, haircuts, and shaving](https://www.ou.org/holidays/the-three-weeks/halacha-lmaaseh-on-the-three-weeks-and-tisha-bav/), 
maybe there's an interpretation there about taking down consumption culture.

Perhaps, since ["the Three Weeks should be a time of increased... giving of charity"](http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/144573/jewish/The-Three-Weeks.htm "s.v. 'The Rebbe urged'"), 
and that the Temples were destroyed because of *sinat hinam*, baseless hatred,
I could give tzedaka to [SPLC](https://www.splcenter.org/) or [ADL](https://www.adl.org/) or other organisations 
that work to combat hatred and discrimination.
