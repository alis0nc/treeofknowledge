I missed Leil Selihot services tonight. I wanted to go to the Conservative community LS at B'nai Moshe 
in West Bloomfield tonight. But I ended up having to help my partner with Penguicon stuff and finding new notebooks
to buy. And I'm pissed at myself for not advocating for myself and telling her I had to somewhere to go no later than 
21:30.

But that leads me into my biggest problem. What do I tell non-religious goyim when I would like to participate in a 
Jewish religious observance that I never had participated in before? Like what the fuck does Leil Selihot service
even mean to me?! What the fuck do Rosh HaShana and Yom Kippur services even mean to me? All I can offer is descriptions
that others have written or told me, because I never experienced these things before. When J. Random Goy asks me why 
I can't hang out erev Easter, I can tell them how much I appreciate the rebirth and renewal and new light symbolism 
of the Easter Vigil mass. I've been to an Easter Vigil mass before, so I can explain. But it's way more difficult if 
someone asks me about Selihot or RH or YK or Sukkot because I never experienced that before. I find myself at a loss 
for words and so often parroting MyJewishLearning or JewFAQ or Chabad.org.

I wish I had a conversion rabbi just so I could talk about things like this with them. I'm a lot less sure of my Jewish 
identity than Sky thinks I am. Anarchist that she is, she wants to co-create a conversion ritual with me and then I dunk 
in the River Rouge or Lake Superior. But I feel like having a conversion rabbi, someone with semikha, might be a valuable
thing because then I could ask them questions like "How do I make goyim realise holidays and the Days of Awe especially
are a deep and real thing, when I haven't even experienced them yet?"
