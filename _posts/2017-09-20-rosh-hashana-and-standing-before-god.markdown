I think I just experienced G‽d. 

I was davening Rosh HaShana maariv by myself (because I didn't feel like 
schlepping to the Downtown Synagogue) and I had my Koren siddur so I could daven the Amidah in Hebrew. 
I'm still not very good at reading Hebrew, so I sound everything out like a first grader, and during one of the 
brakhot I start feeling really nervous and break out in a sweat. Like, here I am, 25 years old, standing before 
HaShem sounding out Hebrew like a first grader. And it actually felt like I was standing before HaShem, like, I 
could feel G‽d's presence. But I could also feel a feeling that G‽d was encouraging me. "Keep reading the Hebrew, 
you're doing just fine. It's okay." So I did.

After the Amidah, I sat down in silence for a few minutes. That experience took quite a lot out of me. And even 
writing about it now, I can't possibly put into words the enormousness of the experience.

The Koren siddur says on its cover -- "דע לפני מי אתה עומד", or "know before whom you stand."

I respond -- "אני יודעת לפני מי אני עומדת", "I know before whom I stand."
