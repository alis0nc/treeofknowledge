Today is 18 Elul, which is also the birthday (in 5458) of the Baal Shem Tov, the founder of Hasidism, 
and the birthday (in 5505) of Shneur Zalman of Liadi aka the Alter Rebbe, the founder of Chabad-Lubavitch.

Selihot notes follow.

 * Chapter subtitle: "This Is Real And You Are Completely Unprepared": Selihot as a distillation of the 
   Days of Awe?
 * awareness of our circumstances leads to urgency/desperation? (Selihot -- urgent, desperate prayer)
 * Traditional -- midnight service on motzaei shabbat before Rosh HaShana, continues each dawn until RH
 * Urgency. in less than one week we will stand before God at Rosh HaShana
 * According to the midrash, God came down as a shaliah tzibbur wrapped in a tallit, and revealed the order
   of Selihot to Moshe
 * all of Israel standing before God as a single unit
 * a story about Lew's mom and freezing in front of the Carnegie Hall audience. Analogy? Will we freeze before 
   the aweing presence of God, or will we redeem ourselves and our past failures? or is God the nervous one, 
   stood before all Israel?
 * Baal Shem Tov says God is close to the brokenhearted
 * birth experience
 * every preparation we make for Rosh HaShana, no matter how fervent, is in vain
 * **Some of us will die. Some of us will live. All of us will change.**
 * Rabbi Akiva -- everything is given on credit and a net is spread for all the living
 * we get to Rosh HaShana and Yom Kippur and realise all our preparations are in vain
 * Avinu malkeinu, hanenu v'anenu ki ein banu maasim (Our Father Our King, have mercy on us and answer us, 
   for we have no good deeds)
 * So what can we do if we have no good deeds? 
   1. come together in minyanim. *agudat achat* -- form a larger spiritual entity
   2. *v'hitvadu*. make confession. open our hearts
   3. perform Selihot and Rosh HaShana services. because God wrapped Godself in a tallit and revealed it to all Israel
