A few weeks ago, I was in Ann Arbor on a Friday because my therapist appointment 
got rescheduled from its usual Thursday slot. So I was like, "Friday afternoon? 
City I'm not usually in? Let's daven someplace new!" I attended the Ann Arbor 
Orthodox Minyan for kabbalat shabbat and shabbat maariv, and was able to keep 
up with the pace of davening pretty well despite never having attended an 
orthodox service before.

Someone who works at the Farmington Library had invited me to their Modern 
Orthodox shul, which is in Oak Park. So I decided to daven there for shaharit 
on Shabbat Vayeshev morning. The shul said prayers (all of which were when the 
Torah was out) for the state of Israel, IDF, United States, and US military. 
The rabbi's drasha started by making the point that throughout the book of Genesis, 
a reoccurring theme is the struggle between older brother and younger brother -- 
from this parsha's story of Joseph's brothers selling him off into slavery, to Cain 
and Abel, to Jacob and Esau, and ending with Jacob blessing Efraim and Menashe. 
That was a good point, but the rabbi quickly went off on a tangent relating to 
Trump's recent decision to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and move 
the embassy there from Tel Aviv. He talked about how countries who maintained 
embassies in Tel Aviv were "kidding themselves" when the Knesset, the Prime 
Minister's residence, etc. are all in Jerusalem. And this rant was mamash political 
and didn't even cite any scriptural or talmudic or midrashic sources. I can't even 
bring myself to call it a dvar Torah. When someone's getting political on the bimah 
at Tchiyah or the Downtown Synagogue or a DJJ event, they can back it up with 
arguments that draw on Torah. (R' Alana is good at this.)

So I was left with a bad taste in my mouth for orthodoxy, and a question. WHERE does 
a person who prefers davening with a mehitza and finds meaning in mitzvot observance, 
but also loves doing justice Jewishly and is a leftist and thinks politics from the 
bimah (without a solid backing in Torah) and tefillot for governments and militaries 
have no place in shul.... where do we go? Where do we belong? Is there a place for us?
