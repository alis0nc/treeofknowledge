Usual *TIRAYACU* type post here -- unstructured notes.

 * shofar is blown on Rosh Hodesh Elul and then every morning in Elul, to *constantly remind* us that 
   the moment of standing before God is drawing nigh.
 * month of prayer, tzedaka, teshuva
 * each parsha we read in Elul tells us: "Wake up! Wake up!"
 * parallels what's on the cover of the Koren siddurim: "דע לפני מי אתה עומד" -- know before whom you stand

The parshiot we read in Elul: 

### ראה -- Reeh

 * Look, I place before you a blessing and a curse -- choose the blessings 
 * self evaluation and self judgment, spiritual accounting (heshbon ha-nefesh) throughout Elul
 * practical advice for how to do this is lacking in classical commentaries, so Lew provides some
   * **Prayer**: l'hitpallel: to judge oneself. you can't justify before HaShem things that you knew
     to be wrong when you did them. knowing what distracts you from prayer is also useful (especially 
     communal prayer)
   * **Meditation**: setting aside time each day to look inward. meditation can lead to *being present* in 
     other aspects of life too. seeing that we are part of something larger than ourselves -- psalm 33
   * **Focus on one thing**: it doesn't have to be prayer or meditation. it can be something in daily life. 
     eating only out of hunger, being candid regarding sexual desire, becoming mindful about the money you spend
 * But what do we do if we feel like we've become mindful of these things already? Or if we already have a daily
   prayer or meditation practise? Is there always room for improvement
 * Prayer: there's a BIG "דע לפני מי אתה עומד" theme here

### שופטים -- Shoftim

 * Plain reading: Establish a judicial system. 
 * *Iturei Torah* (Hasidic Torah commentary) interprets this parsha as an exhortation to mindfullness and teshuva -- 
   to judge yourself
 * is there a point here about *shofet* vs *dayan*? I don't know the difference in meaning between the two words.
 * Laws of war -- someone who's left something incomplete can't focus on the task at hand
   * there's a point here about my thesis, maybe.
   * tie up the loose ends
 * Another point: emotions are contagious (though I don't agree with Lew when he says (p.81) that "when we leave 
   [the depressed friend], they will feel better but we will feel worse)
 * not visiting a sick person to *do anything* for them, but to *be with* them -- the best gift is the gift of ones 
   presence

### כי־תצא -- Ki Tetze

 * Elul -- Psalm 27. lots of warlike imagery this month. 
 * this parsha is about the spoils of war
 * Impulse control seems to be a big message of this parsha. And things not being always as they seem
 * Lew makes the point (p.89) that there's an upside to us getting kicked out of Gan Eden. Is he going to make 
   the same point about the BHM? Did I miss this point in the 9 Av chapter?
 * Don't squelch the yetzer hara, since it's the source of creativity and productivity (we need to examine it and 
   keep it in check though)
 * watch the impulse arise, but wait to act on it
