So tomorrow is the 17th of Tammuz. According to [Chabad](http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/479885/jewish/The-17th-of-Tammuz.htm), 
the fast commemorates five tragedies that befell the Jews in ancient times: 

1. Moses broke the tablets on which were written the Ten Commandments, when he saw the Hebrews 
   worshipping the golden calf.
2. *During the Babylonian siege of Jerusalem, Jews had to stop offering the daily sacrifices 
   at the Temple due to lack of sheep.*
3. Apostomos (who was either a Greek general or a Roman general) burned the Torah.
4. *An idol was placed in the Temple.*
5. *In 69 CE, the Romans breached the walls of Jerusalem. Three weeks later, on 9 Av, they destroyed 
   the second Temple.*

Also, the Jerusalem Talmud claims that 17 Tammuz was the day that the Babylonians breached Jerusalem's walls
before destroying the first Temple in 587 BCE.

So of these five tragedies, three of them (the ones in *italics*) have to do in some way with the Temple. 
So what is 17 Tammuz supposed to mean to Jews who don't care if the Temple gets rebuilt, or if they don't 
identify with the sacrificial system, or if they don't identify with Jerusalem?

**Hard questions!**

Anyway, since 17 Tammuz is a minor fast, sunrise is at 06:07 and sunset is 21:11, if I feel compelled to fast.
